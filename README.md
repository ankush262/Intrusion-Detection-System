# 🔐 Real-Time Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project is a real-time **Intrusion Detection System** (IDS) that captures and analyzes live network traffic to detect suspicious activity using machine learning. It is built on top of a custom Python-based implementation of **CICFlowMeter**, and integrates a web-based dashboard to display detection results in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time network traffic monitoring
- 📦 Flow-based feature extraction (CICFlowMeter-style)
- 🤖 Machine learning model for intrusion detection
- 🌐 Web dashboard for visualization and alerts
- 🖥️ Supports live capture or PCAP file analysis

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnkitV15/Intrusion-Detection-System.git
cd Intrusion-Detection-System
```

2.**Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3.**Run with administrator privileges (for packet capture):**

```bash
sudo python flowmeter.py --interface INTERFACE
```

> 🔧 Replace `INTERFACE` with your actual network interface name. Use `python list_interfaces.py` to list available interfaces.

## 📡 Live Traffic Monitoring

To start real-time monitoring and feature extraction:

```bash
sudo python flowmeter.py --interface INTERFACE
```

This will capture live packets and save flow-based features to `data/out/`.

## 📂 Analyze PCAP Files

You can also analyze offline traffic using `.pcap` files:

```bash
sudo python flowmeter.py --pcap-path /path/to/pcaps
```

Output CSVs will be saved to `data/out/` (or use `--out-path` to change it).

## 🧠 Machine Learning IDS + Dashboard

The IDS uses a trained ML model to predict attacks based on extracted features. To launch the real-time prediction dashboard:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and go to:

```bash
http://localhost:5000
```

## Specify in Live traffic monitoring

```bash
sudo python flowmeter.py --interface INTERFACE --dashboard-url http://localhost:5000/predict
```

You’ll see:

- 📈 Live prediction updates
- 🛡️ Classification results (e.g., DoS, PortScan, Benign, etc.)
- 🔔 Alert system for threats

## 🧪 Simulate Traffic (Optional)

You can generate dummy `.pcap` files for testing:

```bash
python generate_pcaps.py
```

## 🛑 Stopping the System

Use `Ctrl + C` to safely stop any running script, especially during live sniffing.

## 💡 Notes

- Make sure you run the `flowmeter.py` script **before** launching `app.py`.
- Your ML model and scaler should be pre-trained and saved in the `models/` directory.
- Tested on Python 3.10+
